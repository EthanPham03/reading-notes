Some popular uses of pfSense include Firewall, VPN router, DNS blacklist, and LAN router. 

You'll need a computer with at least two network cards. 

Free support can be found on forums, the mailing list and IRC. Commercial support is offered by BSD perimeter. 

Automatic configuration backup can be found within the Services tab in pfSense.

I don't think there are any influences that cultural differences may have in the ability to deal with routers and firewalls.
