A shell is what allows people to interact with the computer. 

Bash can locate the systems with commands including 'which bash' and 'which ls'.

You can determine the information by running the command 'echo $0 bash'.

Anything that can be tyoed into Bash can be typed into a plaintext file, and be run. This is what makes it both powerful and scriptable.

I customize my time management in order to maximize the effiency of my daily tasks including work, OPS courses, and my personal life.
