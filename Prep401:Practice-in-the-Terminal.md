## Practics in the Terminal


The command line is just another word for the terminal so it isn't unfamiliar.

Basic navigation is just shortcut commands on the computer. Commands like cd and ls will pull up the directories of the computer. For files and programs, commands like /etc, /var/log, /bin, and /usr/bin are used. 

Everything in the computer is a file. Files include executables, texts, and images.

Manual pages are pages that explain every command in the system and what they do

Terminals have commands that create, edit, and delete files and directories in a computer. Commands include mkdir, touch, and rm.
