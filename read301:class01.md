The term OSI stands for Open System Interconnection

The physical Layer is responsible for the physical connection between devices. Data Link Layer is responsible for node-to-node delivery of messages. Network Layer is responsible for data transmission from host to host in different networks. The transport layer is responsible for taking services from the network layer and providing services to the application layer. The session layer is responsible for establishing connections, maintaining sessions, and authenticating and ensuring security. Presentation layer or the translation layer is responsible for manipulating data from the application layer to transmit over the network. The application layer is responsible for application services to access the network.

The hardware layers would be the physical, and network. The software layers would be the data link, transport, session, presentation, and application layers.

The model helps networking professionals better understand data abstraction paths and processes.

Wireshrak is a network protocol analyser that also captures packets from a network connection.

A packet is a discrete unit of data in an Ethernet network.

The three high-level things that Wireshark does is packet capture, filtering, and visualization. These things can allow people to find information of others on a network.
