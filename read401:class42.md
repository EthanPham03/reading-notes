The six techiniques are pass-the-hash, pass-the-ticket, overpass-the-hash (pass-the-key), kerberoast golden tickets, kerberoast selver tickets, and pass-the-cache. Pass-the-hash is when pass the hash string of the store password data to log in. Pass-the-ticket functions similar to the previous one in that it passes a Kerberos ticket to log in.

The four ways to defend are to change admin privileges, change caching policy, turn off debugging privileges, and increase local security authority. Changing admin privileges works by limiting the privileges to those who need them. Turning off debugging privileges works by disabling what Mimikatz can exploit.
