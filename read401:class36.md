Cross-site scripting is a vulnerability that lets an attacker mess with the a user's interactions with an application. 

Three tyoes of XSS are reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS.

An attacker can use XSS to impersonate to be the victim or they could capture login information. 

Ways to prevent a XSS attack are to filter input on arrival, encode data on output, use appropriate response headers, and content security policy.
