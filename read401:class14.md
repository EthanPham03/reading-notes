The main feature of an IDS is to alert for incidents rather while firewall will keep out threats. 

I would choose network-based if I want a quicker response and want to monitor everything on a network segment. 

Some cons to NIDS are that they don't process encrypted packets, have frequent false positives, and vulnerable to protocol based attacks.
