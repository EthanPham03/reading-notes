Threat hunting's goal is to identify and mitigate threats already in a network as fast as possible. The difference is that threat hunting is a more proactive approach. 

The four types of rules are string-based, file metadata-based, hash-based, and network-based rules. String-based uses strings of text to identify malware. File metadata-based uses metadata to identify. Hash-based uses hashes to identify. Network-based uses network traffic data. 

YARA is used to detect malware on a computer or network.
