Authentication is pretty self-explanitory as it just authenticates the correct user to access the network. Authorization just looks at the network features and chooses whats is allowed access. Accounting just looks at what the user is doing on the network. 

They should mention using the local database as a backup in the method list.

NAS sends a request and the ACS server takes that request to allow or not allow access to network resources.

One of the benefits to RADIUS is that is is used for remote access across many types of networks. 

RADIUS stands for remote authentication dial-in user service. This is a software that allows remote services to communicate with the central server for authentication and authorization. 

The encryption algorithm used is the MD5 algorithm.
