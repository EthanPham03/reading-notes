The shell is a program which gives commands to the operating system. The terminal is what lets people interact with the shell. CLI stands for command line interface and is a text-based interface. The command prompt is an application that executes commands.

To change directories, type the command cd which is an abbreviation for change directory. To list files, type ls. To rename or move files, type mv.

Absolute paths are direct roouts to files while relative paths are paths in which the file is relative to the working directory.
