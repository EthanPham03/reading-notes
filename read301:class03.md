A CIDR notation is something that represents a CIDR block. A CIDR block is a range od IP addresses. 

Four octets are in an IPv4. 

In an octet, there is a range of 0-255

That number is how many bits make the subnet mask

Two hundred fifty-six IP addresses can be found on that block.

It's when devices like firewall, switches, and routers seperate certain areas in a network, network zone, or computer.

A screened subnet is a bunch of subnetworks which show facing systems. 

They would be examples of traditional physical security.
