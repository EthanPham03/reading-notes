The Windoes System Restore Tool allows the ability to restore previos, software, regristry, and driver configuration.

When using the tool, it'll take ten to thirty minutes to complete any reversions.

You can start the tool through command prompt with the command "rstrui.exe".

If the tool fails, then try retoring again after switching the computer to safe mode
