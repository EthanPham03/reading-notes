Powershell pushes structured date rather than bunches of text. It also works with objects while Bash works with string.

You would use it as a system administrator, systems engineer, and system arcitect. Platforms that support Powershell are windows, linux and AWS. 

Powershell has automative capabilities, is very accurate, and is what is revelant right now. 

Repetitve steps can lead to mistakes, and Powershell's automation tests to ensure accuracy. 

As of now, there isn't a scenario in which I would use Powershell. The only time would be in my online Code Fellows class doing homework.
