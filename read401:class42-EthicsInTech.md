I'll be relating the articles to ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct

The Google article talks about it's AI. The main thing it discusses is how it does not plan to have its AI work with the U.S. military for offensive projects. This relates to how as a computing professional, they should avoid harm. 

The second article is about the ethics of self-driving cars. The main idea it brings up is how the car would decide who lives and who dies in certain situations. This also relates to the principle of avoiding harm.
