## Emotional Intelligence
I scored a 19 in self awareness, a 24 in self management, a 21 in social awareness, and an 18 in relationship management. According to the self-assessment tool, there isn't an area that would require any improvement. If I were to improve one area it would be my relationship management. Otherwise I'm completely content with my score. 

## My Biases
After taking the bias self-assessment, I got a total score of 82 out of 120. A score of 82 means that there's areas that require some improvement. The strongest areas are "What is Bias" and "Connect to Mitigate Bias". My weakest area is "Four Ways to Act".
