The Command Prompt is an application that interprets the command line.

The Command Prompt can be found in the start menu or the apps screen. Another way to access it is to use the cmd Run command.

There are eleven commonly used commands: chkdsk, copy, ftp, del, format, ping, attrib, net, dir, help, and shutdown.

The Windows PowerShell is a more advanced command line interpreter.

The Windows Terminal is an application that uses both the PowerShell and Command Prompt.
