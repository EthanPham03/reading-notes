A port is an area where network communication begins and ends. It's like a real life port where cargo ships recieve or drop off cargo. 

A port scanner will send a portion of network data to check. 

The three responses are 'Open, Accepted', 'Closed, Not Listening', and 'Filtered, Dropped, Blocked'. The open response is when the computer will ask if there is anything it can do. The closed response is when the computer will state that the port is in use or unavailable. The filtered response is when the computer doesn't respond. 

There are two types of scans for TCP (TCP half open and TCP connect). UDP is slower than TCP scans

Telnet allows remote connection to a device and the ability to view the information on a terminal screen. SSH puts information that is sent across the network in encrypted form. DNS converts a name that is typed to the IP address. SMTP is the most common way for email communication. HTTP is a nonencrypted way of sending information to a server. HTTPS is like HTTP but encrypted. RDP allows the ability to share desktop view.
