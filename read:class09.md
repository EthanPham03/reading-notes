It is a procedure that has a set of activities that are required to complete a specific task. They are important because they are the main way to enforce policies.

One of them is Policy, which provides guidance. The second would be SOP to answer what should be done and why. The third is work instructions which gives instructions to complete tasks. 

Because they make it so tha policys bring organizations closer to their goals. 

There are five things that are to be considered: SOP should be readable; it should be consumable, it should be understandable, it should be actionable, it should be measurable. They should be considered so that others may be able to follow the policies clearly and they can be easily observed.

The main thing to do is to write the SOP in multiple different languages so that it's readable for others.
