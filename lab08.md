An ISO file is a file that represents an entire CD, DVD, or BD.

To write an ISO file to a CD, DVD, or removeable media, you would burn it to the CD, DVD, or removeable media.

ISO files are created through the use of different programs

To mount an ISO file, you would open the file with a disc emulater then choose a driving letter which will represent the file.
