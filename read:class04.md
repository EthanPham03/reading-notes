You should seperate the problems and trouble-shoot on a single problem before moving on to the next.

When a solution is identified, you should impplement the solution and run a test to make sure the system is working properly. After this is successful, implement measures to prevent the problem from reoccuring. 

It's beneficial to document your solution so that if the problem returns, it can be easily addressed.

A device I like to use is my playstation console. I've rarely had trouble on the device with my troubles being just not enough console storage at worst. In order to solve the issue, I would go into the storage tab in settings, then I would manually remove any software that is taking up any space in my console.
