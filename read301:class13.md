An Active Directory is a directory from Microsoft for Windows domain networks. The services it has are domain, lightweight directory, certificate, federation, and rights management services. 

A domain is a collection of things like users and devices that are part of the same Active Directory. A tress is a collection of domains with a contiguous namespace. A forest is a collection of trees. 

They are grouped into organizational units or OUs.
