A sniffing attack is done by getting information on a network and then sending  it multiple times to a victim. 

The two types are passive sniffing and active sniffing. Passive does not involve interference which means it's less likely to raise suspicion. Active uses crafted packets to bypass security measures. 

Ecrypting the traffic makes it so the data is difficult for the sniffing attacks to capture.
